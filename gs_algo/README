Gale–Shapley algorithm

The stable matching problem, in its most basic form, takes as input equal numbers of two types of participants (n men and n women, or n medical students and n internships, for example), and an ordering for each participant giving their preference for whom to be matched to among the participants of the other type. A stable matching always exists, and the algorithmic problem solved by the Gale–Shapley algorithm is to find one. A matching is not stable if:

There is an element A of the first matched set which prefers some given element B of the second matched set over the element to which A is already matched, and
B also prefers A over the element to which B is already matched.
In other words, a matching is stable when there is no pair (A, B) where both participants prefer each other to their matched partners.
